    <h2>Dulce de Leche Flan</h2>
    <p>Here’s a classic Dulce de Leche Flan (Flan de Cajeta or Flan de Leche Condensada) recipe you can try at home. It’s creamy, silky, and has that caramelized sweetness from dulce de leche:</p>
    <section>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup sugar (for caramel)</li>
        <li>1 can (13.4 oz / 380 g) dulce de leche</li>
        <li>1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 can (12 oz) evaporated milk</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Make the caramel:
          
          In a medium saucepan, melt the sugar over medium heat until it turns a golden amber color (about 8–10 minutes).
          
          Immediately pour the caramel into a round baking dish or 6–8 ramekins, tilting to coat the bottom evenly. Set aside to harden.</li>
        <li>Prepare the flan mixture:
          
          In a blender, combine dulce de leche, sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, eggs, vanilla, and salt.
          
          Blend until smooth and fully mixed.</li>
        <li>Bake in water bath:
          
          Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
          
          Pour the flan mixture over the hardened caramel in the baking dish.
          
          Place the dish inside a larger baking pan and fill the outer pan with hot water halfway up the sides (this prevents cracking and keeps the texture silky).</li>
        <li>Bake:
          
          Bake for 50–60 minutes, or until the center is just set but still slightly jiggly.
          
          Remove from oven, let it cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours (preferably overnight).</li>
        <li>Unmold and serve:
          
          Run a knife around the edges to loosen.
          
          Place a plate over the baking dish and carefully flip it to release the flan with caramel sauce on top.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Tips</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>You can substitute cajeta (goat’s milk caramel) for a deeper, tangier flavor.</li>
        <li>Garnish with whipped cream, toasted coconut, or berries for presentation.</li>
        <li>If you like a firmer flan, add one extra egg.</li>
      </ul>
